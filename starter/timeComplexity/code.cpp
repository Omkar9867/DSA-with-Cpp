//Time Complexities(
// 1. Constant --> O(1) || O(k) which is parrallel to x axis and is the most complex time.
// 2. Linear --> O(n) loop runs same time as the n , so x=y .
// 3. --> O(n^2) || O(n^3) generally on 2 || 3 nested loop  , the complexity of n running is double
// 4. ---> O(logn) second best time complexity , generally if in any algo we encounter situation where the arr or val is decreasing to half to find solution0 .
// 5. ---> n(logn)
